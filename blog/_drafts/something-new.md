Sample Desktop PKCE app

June 2022
* reactive experience
  * but i'm glad i did it as it's helped me think more about how i write on a servlet stack
* why i dont' think of myself as a javascript expert
* m1 apple silicon spring boot native image
* spring boot pkce
* azure app registrations
* auth0

1. note resource server
- r2dbc h2
basic keycloak
2 realms
master (for admin) pw admin/admin
jhipster
- where client defined web_app/web_app
- where user defined, user/user and admin/admin (note: different than master realm's admin user)
- get access token
- create note
- get all notes

2. ui via spring cloud gateway and create react app
- use crud example (using hooks!) and matt raible's crud (using session but with MVC and react router)
spring cloud gateway for SPA
- why webflux?
- why spring cloud gateway? simple and secure token managment and token relay
- handles oauth2/OIDC relay
- keeps tokens secure
- can refresh tokens without redirection
- SSO
- better resource utilization than mvc. less threads -> less memory
- index.html issue
- oidc post_logout_redirect_uri
- /private
- /api/user
- ignore pathPatterns
- proxy
- spring session with redis if you need to scale
- csrf
- spring cloud gateway predicates!

3. policy server (county sheriff) (make the case on simplestep.ca and the examples on sdoxsee.github.com)
- why? because just because your passport says when you were born and where you come from, doesn't mean that your identity brings you the same privileges wherever you go
- authorization server is about users giving authorization to clients to access their information but not about what your application says your user can or cannot do
- identity != authorization
- identity + permissions = authorization
https://leastprivilege.com/2016/12/16/identity-vs-permissions/
- although you want to be "stateless" overloading the token with permissions goes too far. 
- why centralized? reduce duplication, simplify management but not be all end all. there is still business logic that belongs in your app itself
- might relay the token, or might make a specific client credentials calls. latter probably better. client of county sheriff
- local option is not tech-agnositic. commercial is neither SaaS nor freemium. don't recommend hierarchy but simple overrides
- notes secure
- video demo
- open questions (secure policy server, integrations and UI). it's more making a case for this space

Practice event sourcing

Focus architecture, java, security, oauth2, openid connect, SAML?, CI/CD on k8s
