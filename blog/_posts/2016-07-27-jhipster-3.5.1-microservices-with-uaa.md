The JHipster UAA (User Account and Authentication) server option shouldn't be confused with [cloudfoundry's UAA](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa) -- although they do similar things. 

JHipster allows you to generate a UAA app that contains the user database and is responsible for authenticating users and granting oauth2 JWT access tokens using a spring-security authorization server.

Since JHipster currently uses the gateway for the login screen, there can be no SSO between different gateway apps. However, it makes for a familiar JHipster experience with UAA acting only as the backend for user-management and authentication. UAA does expose its public key at http://localhost:9999/oauth/token but otherwise acts invisibly.

# Setup

Folder structure:

    jhipster-uaa
    |- gateway
    |- jhipster-registry
    |- resource
    |- uaa

> **hint**: you should handle each project in a separate tab

## jhipster-registry
Inside a new jhipster-uaa folder, I clone the jhipster-registry and start it up.
    
    git clone https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-registry
    cd jhipster-registry
    ./mvnw

## uaa
Beside the new jhipster-registry folder created by the clone, I create the uaa project

    mkdir uaa
    cd uaa
    yo jhipster

...choosing the UAA option and selecting defaults otherwise.

and start it up (important: after the jhipster-registry is up)

    ./mvnw

## resource
Next, I create the resource project inside the jhipster-uaa folder:

    mkdir resource
    cd resource
    yo jhipster

...choosing the UAA option and selecting defaults otherwise.

Next, I create the "foo" entity
    
    yo jhipster:entity foo

...only selecting one "name" field of type String.

Then, start up the resource project (important: after UAA is registered with jhipster-registry)

    ./mvnw

## gateway
Next, I create the gateway project inside the jhipster-uaa folder

    mkdir gateway
    cd gateway
    yo jhipster

...choosing the UAA option and selecting defaults otherwise.

Just like the resource project, I create the "foo" entity

    yo jhipster:entity foo

...regenerating based on the one in resource.

Then, start up the gateway project (important: after UAA is registered with jhipster-registry)

    ./mvnw

# Try it out!
Wait until everything is up and then you should be good to go!
